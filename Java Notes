#In Matrix problems have the var_names as row and col.

Arrays.sort(a_name);  // can sort arrays of all data-types

##### To obtain the fraction part of a double ####
double num;
iPart = (long) num;
fPart = num - iPart;

Method overloading - Same name diff parameters
       overriding - 
       
Static variable - common for all the objects
       method - does not belong to any object and can be called only with class_name.fun() directly 
                can use only static var's inside it.
       block - used for initialization ,will be invoked first.

this keyword  - when there is ambig. between the class member's and the local var's [both have same names] , this resolves 
                the conflict by pointing to the class members.
                
                
Inheritance : class A extends B{}
              Multiple - One parent many child . (not supported as both parents may have same function names which causes ambiguity)
final :       fixes the value of a variable.
              final methods are
